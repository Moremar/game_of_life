# game_of_life

This program is a Python TkInter GUI for John Conway's Game of Life.

A 40x40 square of cells is randomly populated with cells from a given seed.
The seed can be chosen to generate different evolution scenarios.

The evolution of the cells can be observed either live or step by step.
